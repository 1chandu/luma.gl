## Precision

WebGL does not expose native 64-bit floating point number support of modern desktop GPUs to developers. As an alternative, this module uses two 32-bit native floating point number to extend and preserve significant digits and uses algorithms similar to those used in many multiple precision math libraries to achieve precision close to what IEEE-754 double precision floating point numbers provide. Generally speaking, this mechanism provide 46 significant digits in mantissa (48 overall) within the normal range of 32-bit single precision float point numbers. This transfers to ~ `1x10^-15` relative error within ~ `1.2x10^-38` and `1.7x10^+38`.

The error bound as tested on 2015 MacBook Pro with AMD Radeon R9 M370X GPU (`ulp` = [unit of least precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place)).

```
| Operation                | Precision  | Comment |
| ---                      | ---        | --- |
| Addition and subtraction | < 1 ulp    | |
| Multiplication           | ~1.5 ulps  | |
| Division                 | ~2 ulps    | |
| Square root              | ~2.6 ulps  | |
| Exponential              | ~2.6 ulps  | |
| Logarithm                | ~11.6 ulps | depends on accuracy of native log() function |
| Trigonometry             | ~5 ulps    | |


## Performance Implications

### Execution Speed

Since 64-bit floating point math is emulated using the multiple precision arithmetic, it costs significantly more GPU cycles than native 32-bit math (more than an order of magnitude (~10x).

However, by using 64-bit math only in accuracy critical paths, the performance impact of using 64-bit calculations will normally be significantly less than an order of magnitude.

For many applications, the amount of time spent in e.g. the vertex shading stage is only part of the time spent in the whole the rendering pipeline.

Some GPUs use non-IEEE compliant "fast-math" functions to trade accuracy for speed. When comparing with custom GPU functions to improve 32 bit precision (such functions are provided by the companion `fp32` shader module), the performance difference between 32 and 64 bit is of course somewhat smaller.


### Memory Usage

There will be a memory impact too, in that vertex attributes and uniform data that use 64-bit values require double storage space in JavaScirpt.


### Shader Compilation Time

The `fp64` package is fairly large and can affect shader compilation times. Note that shader compilation times can vary significantly between environment (GPU drivers/browsers/operating systems).
