### 2.3.0 - Decoupled headless-gl dependency

- It is now necessary to import luma.gl through `luma.gl/headless` to get
headless integration.
  When using the basic `luma.gl` import, the app no longer needs to
have `gl` as a dependency.
 This should simplify build and setup for applications that don't use
headless-gl.

### 2.2.0
  - Fixed a doc mistake

### 2.1.0 - Copy of 2.0.0 release
  - Published mainly to ensure 2.0.4-0 does not get included by
  semver wildcards.

### 2.0.0 - Major API refactoring
